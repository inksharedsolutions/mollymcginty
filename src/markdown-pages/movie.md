For those of you who are a favorite of Hallmark movies and have seen some of them for the seventh time-- here’s a really good ‘formula’ movie following the same format: On NETFLIX, the title is THE HEALER. Shot on location in Nova Scotia, there is 1) a problem or a problematic situation 2) a plot easy to follow – usually keeping the potentially leads romantically apart for just another scene! 3) several minor characters with quirky personalities and strong suggestions for the troubled pair 4) and finally, the solution. 

THE HEALER has an interesting supporting cast and a few extra bumps along the way, I shed a tear or two myself. 

Let me know your thoughts about this one!

What have YOU been watching the last six weeks? Sports shows are repeats, mostly of past championships. Series have been grinding through their season. (Who are YOUR favorites)?

Have you gotten that much-needed stylish haircut yet? Mine is growing to match my shoulders, but that’s okay. My hairdresser of many years returns into full swing in a few weeks! Can’t wait!

SPRING is here! Are you thinking about your own garden? Last year I planted a lot of Annuals. This year only Perennials. Have you noticed the tags do not SAY which it is? Any suggestions for Zone 5?  (Next early Spring I might start my own bulbs and then do seedlings as well!) Send pictures if you have some beauties in your yard.
