What are your comments about “Key West Interlude”? I would love to read them. See if we can’t get a dialogue going! Would be fun!

	
Key West has an uneasy air about it that lifts a story with ‘ordinary’ characters to the level of a good murder mystery. Soon you learn the kinds of people who live there, underneath their wiry hair, thongs, and who cares? Attitude are carrying their pains of the past and are there to live a life of their choosing, many, no matter what the circumstances, are looking forward to the joys ahead.

Key West is a wonderful place. Literally the end of the world –at least for the United States and especially Florida. Arrivals live free of success and money—although it takes a fortune to live there – and many have to take two or three jobs in order to stay, or else room with at least five or six guys working all kinds of hours—but they are “living in Paradise”. For some, this never wears thin. The regular residents are second and third generation “conchs” as they are called; even graduates from college who return home to run their parents’ business. Others are escapees from failed marriages, drugs and alcohol their shadow life who no longer worry about 401-K’s or private schools or the desire to have the biggest, shiniest car in the neighborhood. 

I found my central theme for “Key West Interlude” when I read the cover of the Key West newspaper one Sunday, “Sea Captain found face down: dead.” It intrigued me. Every fisherman I had ever known would never jump from his own boat unless it was on fire, and would never ever leave his passengers behind. 

Enter Paulette Marshall heading for Key West to recover from a difficult divorce mostly concerning a fight for the division of property. Her doctor-husband who already had another pregnant future partner in mind, he wished to share the magnificent house with a full view of the entire city--that by state law belonged to his ex-wife Paulette until their son finished college.

Intrigued yet?


How does Paulette fit in? What does she decide? How does she hold up, knowing she left all that was familiar behind, at least temporarily? I hope these additional topics and other characters add to the thrill of ‘who killed Captain Maxwell?’
