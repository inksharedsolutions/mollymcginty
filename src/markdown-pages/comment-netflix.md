I waited with great anticipation and was very excited to view HOLLYWOOD. A great single subject encasing many successful and working actors as characters were in the film. There is also a great script, (In my opinion, Patti LaBelle steals all her scenes: A powerful presence throughout.)

The first week HOLLYWOOD was Number 2 in the ratings on Netflix, and RIGHT AFTER THAT, boom, down to fitting into alphabetical order.


####WHY? 

I’ll give you my opinion. The first half was so excellently done, raunchy but truthful regarding the Hollywood system and how the last old guys in power held on until the ‘60’s when “Easy Rider” changed the face of films. Released as an independent film, it caught on fire and made stars of Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda (already well-known thanks to father Henry Fonda), famous.


For the second half of the script/movie writers, I wonder who Ian Brennan asked about this turn of events in the audiences’ taste (or is it the other way around?) Ian was an actor and took on the role of producer of this film that fell off before the 60’s… in other words, what was he going to do with that information about the change, etc.? (Would like to ask him in an interview some time).


HOLLYWOOD did not talk about the loss of power at the Hollywood Studios as movies went from this feel-good fluff from the 30’s to the end of the 50’s, switching in the  60’s to guns, gangs, and sadly today, to super-spectacles where heroes shoot the good or bad guy while creating a laugh or two. (Unfortunately, those themes are still with us and have remained the biggest action-fantasy side of thrilling, still killing, maiming, or whatever it takes to put the other guy out of the way. Millions come in when one of these come out, so why stop now? They are still money in the bank.


Regarding Hudson, Universal Studios did not have a talent on their hands, they had a dreamboat, still under contract as he aged. To finish off his obligation to Universal he did a television show with Susan St. James. He was well-seasoned by then and far from the shy star-struck farm boy he once was reported to be.

I had the chance to interview him for a television insert magazine from the east coast. 


Tired, no doubt, of the interview process, he agreed to an interview anyway. My publicist friends knew how excited I was to meet him and talk about the show. He was ever so handsome, polite and had heard about my nervousness, saying afterwards to his publicist, “The trailer shook the whole time!” 


Before I went on the interview, I asked an old-time columnist friend of mine (Fredda Dudley Balling), (who ghosted the first advice column for Claudette Colbert) –before Dear Abby—I asked Fredda why the general public was not aware of Hudson’s preferences during the time of his popularity. (If this happened in today’s market, you know it would be splashed everywhere, as reporters and newspapers live on salaciousness). Fredda said “He was such a dear man. We all loved him anyway. So we chose to give him his privacy. Besides, how many tickets could the studios sell if the truth be told?”


Have you read “Wanted: First Mate”? It is still available on Amazon. Way too expensive however. Many libraries still have “Wanted” on their shelves. If not, have your library write to: Lake Worth Public Library, 15 No. M Street, Lake Worth, Fla., 33460. Vickie Joslin will be more than happy to forward a copy to your library.
