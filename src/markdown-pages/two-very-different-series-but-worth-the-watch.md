Have you seen Jennifer Aniston in “The Morning Show” (not the real one, on one of the networks”? but an Apple + production. She is FABULOUS. And, of course, the sets are wow and her clothes so tailored and perfect (dream on! They are custom-made) 
WATCH IF YOU CAN STAND the language, the harshness behind the scenes, then you’re set. I found the language rather unnecessary in many of the instances, but it was not my script. 

One of the aspects that struck me right away was how much she looked HER AGE (respectively, I mean that and how great it is to see!) 
Everything she does makes money, so as she made these fun nonsensical movies to get to this grand performance I say a three times WOW! Her very presence changes all the scenes she is in and she developed a character that “awakens” to the reality of what was going on around and behind the scenes of filming The Morning Show, accepting her part and thus the Emmy nominated performance. Quite a great job! Nominated for two Emmys, when they make the next segment financed by Apple + she no-doubt will be a winner! 


WONDERING: Reese purchased the best-seller and great read “Where the Crawdads Sing”…. When is she going into production and announce a cast? (Needs a little less of the birds and more of the romances created (by her? By her editor?) that added mystery to a gentle, spirit-lifting read.
